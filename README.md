# Microsoft AI Learning Hackathon

Here is my work in the Azure OpenAI Python Developer Guide

## Labs

- ### [Lab 0: Starting out](/Labs/lab_0_starting_out.ipynb)
- ### [Lab 1: CosmosDB](/Labs/lab_1_cosmos_db.ipynb)
- ### [Lab 2: Load data](/Labs/lab_2_load_data.ipynb)
- ### [Lab 3: MongoDB vector search](/Labs/lab_3_mongodb_vector_search.ipynb)
- ### [Lab 4: Langchain](/Labs/lab_4_langchain.ipynb)
- ### [Lab 5: Encapsulation](/Labs/lab_6_cosmongo.ipynb)

**Note: I removed the container part since I am using App Service for the backend. However, if your computer can handle Docker then you should go through that** There are some advantages to using Docker. Main one I see is being able to test the exact run environment before deploying. Something which can sometimes be annoying when working with App Service, especially if you have not been keeping track of package requirements.

## Rest of guide

I have decided to mainly focus on the lab notebooks in this repo. It is straightforward going integrating the last notebook here with the Backend provided in the original guide.
